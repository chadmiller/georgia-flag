  <h1>optimum construction</h1>

  <p>The stripes are equal width, with blue on the outside and between three gold stripes. <span class="flbl">Blue </span><span class="flgo">gold </span><span class="flbl">blue </span><span class="flgo">gold </span><span class="flbl">blue </span><span class="flgo">gold </span><span class="flbl">blue</span>. The gold colors are all the same color, and approximately RGB #efd600, or Pantone 7405 C, or Pantone 108 C. The blue colors are all the same color, approximately RGB #001065, or Pantone 662 C, or Pantone 2748 C.</p>

  <p>The ratio for the best presentation is the same as the flag of the USA: 19 units wide by 10 units tall. After accounting for the stripes, it is best thought of, not counting a reinforcing hoist, as 133 units wide, with each stripe being 19 units wide, and each stripe being 70 units tall.</p>

  <p>Refer to it as the "Wisdom, Justice, Moderation Flag" or as "The People's Flag of Georgia".  A link to https://georgia.chad.org/ with that name would be appreciated.</p>

  <p>Your derivative work with slightly different dimensions or slghtly different colors are okay, but please hew as closely to the optimum as possible. Prefer not to produce, over producing something ugly or far outside of optimum.</p>
