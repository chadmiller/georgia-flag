  <h2 class="display-1">Georgia deserves a better flag</h2>

  <h2>A bold new look</h2>

  <p><strong>The current flag is complicated.</strong> There's a little soldier. There are details of florid capital of the columns? And words? <strong>A child could not draw this flag</strong>, and that is a shame. At a distance, moving in the breeze, all those details are just illegible visual noise.</p>

  <p><strong>Blue and gold are beautiful.</strong> We should get rid of red to represent that we do not embrace the violence of the past. The white of innocence is lost too. Our bright golden future is what we should embrace.</a>

  <h2>How to build a flag</h2>

  <p><img class="m-5 p-4" src="arch_of_Flag_of_State_of_Georgia.svg" width="300px" style="background: radial-gradient(closest-side at center, #07166f 0, #07166f 55%, #0000 70%)" />Let us take the golden archway, and place it on a blue field, matching the color of the American flag.</p>

  <p><img class="m-5" src="pillars_only_of_Flag_of_State_of_Georgia.svg" width="300px" style="background: #07166f" />Then, let's throw away the horizontal elements, and the words. And then zoom.</a>

  <h1>The result, People's Flag of Georgia</h1>

  <p>The People's Flag of Georgia is the three gold columns of the constitution arch, on a field of blue. It repesents the principles that uphold the Rule of Law.</p>

  <img src="People's Flag of Georgia.png" class="pt-5 px-5 img-fluid" alt="A flag for the people of Georgia. A deep blue field in te ratio of 19 width to 10 height, with three golden vertical stripes, equal in distance as in width to each other and to the outside edge. Alternating vertical strips of deep blue and gold, repeated to make four blue and three gold.">

  <h2>Reject the Confederacy</h2>

  <p>It's okay to sneer at those who profess a false <em>heritage</em>. The Confederacy was a blip in time that <em>did not even last as long as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Zune&amp;oldid=1297549345">the Microsoft Zune.</a></em>  You have cans in your pantry that have lasted longer. Those who revere the Confederacy have an ignorant wisfulness for a time that was pretty terrible, even for the most privileged, and downright horrific for the least.</p>
  
  <p>If any flag represents the best of the Confederacy, it is the white flag of surrender. The most productive thing the Confederacy accomplished was <em>ceasing to exist.</em></p>

  <h2>We don't need permission</h2>

  <p>The Georgia legislature gets to decide what flags fly over state property, but it doesn't get to decide what we think represents us. We can fly our own flag, and choose what we think is important to say about ourselves.</p>

  <!--
  <h2>Fly your flag</h2>

  <h2>FAQs</h2>

  <p><i>Doesn't this look like the maritime letter G?</i>  Yeah, a bit. Different stripes, and that flag is usually flown dangling, with the stripes horizontal. That is a happy conincidence, given that Georgia is the only US state that starts with a G.</p>

  <p><i>What are the height/width ratios?</i> Same as the flag of the USA: 19:10.</p>

  <p><i>What's the name of the flag?</i> It has one permanent name, "Wisdom, Justice, Moderation Flag". Until it is officially adopted, it can also be referred to as "The People's Flag of Georgia".</p>

  <!--p><i>Can I make them and sell them?</i> The design is copyright by Chad Miller, but the creator gives -->
