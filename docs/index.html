  <h2>A bold new look</h2>

  <p><strong>The current flag is complicated.</strong> There's a little soldier. There are details of florid capitals of the columns. And words! <em>A child could not draw this flag</em>, and that is a shame. At a distance, moving in the breeze, all those details are just illegible visual noise.</p>

  <p><strong>Blue and gold are beautiful.</strong> We should get rid of red to represent that the violence of the past needs not define us. Our bright golden future is what we should embrace.</p>

  <h2>How to build a flag</h2>

  <p>First, discard the Confederate bars.</p>

  <h1>The People's Flag of Georgia</h1>

  <p>The People's Flag, "Wisdom, Justice, Moderation", is the three gold columns of the constitution arch, on a field of blue. It repesents the principles that uphold the Rule of Law.</p>

  <img src="People's%20Flag%20of%20Georgia.png" class="p-5 img-fluid" alt="A flag for the people of Georgia. A deep blue field in te ratio of 19 width to 10 height, with three golden vertical stripes, equal in distance as in width to each other and to the outside edge. Alternating vertical strips of deep blue and gold, repeated to make four blue and three gold.">

  <h2>Reject the Confederacy</h2>

  <p>It's okay to sneer at those who profess to honor an imaginary heritage about the Confederacy. The Confederacy was a blip in time that <em>did not even last as long as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Zune&amp;oldid=1297549345">the Microsoft Zune.</a></em>  You have cans in your pantry that have lasted longer.</p>
  
  <p>If any flag represents the best of the Confederacy, it is the white flag of surrender. The most noble thing the Confederacy accomplished was ceasing to exist.</p>

  <h2>We don't need permission</h2>

  <p>The Georgia legislature gets to decide what flags fly <em>over state property</em>, but it doesn't get to decide what we think represents us. We can fly our own flag, and choose what we think is important to say about ourselves.</p>

  <h2>Fly your flag</h2>

  <h2>FAQs</h2>

  <p><i class="text-info-emphasis">Doesn't this look a bit like <span style="text-decoration: underline solid black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>?</i> &mdash; Yes, it might. Blue and gold look good together and are popular to choose. Let's go through some examples to see if any of them are so poisonous that it would be bad to remind anyone of it:
  <ul>
	  <li><i class="text-info-emphasis">the maritime <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=International_Code_of_Signals&oldid=1287979182#Single-flag_signals">letter G</a></i> &mdash; These are used in different contexts, so not a problem. Signal flags are not used on land, and state flags are not used in maritime operations. It is a happy conincidence, given that Georgia is the only US state that starts with a G. &check;</li>
	  <li><i class="text-info-emphasis">the Human Rights Campaign <a href="https://www.hrc.org/about/logo">logo</a></i> &mdash; Horizontal, not vertical. They don't span the full length. This org aims for equal treatment of some marginalized people, and we should admire that. &check;</li>
  </ul>
  </p>

  <p><i class="text-info-emphasis">What are the height/width ratios?</i> &mdash; Same as the flag of the USA: 19:10.</p>

  <p><i class="text-info-emphasis">What's the name of the flag?</i> &mdash; It has one permanent name, "Wisdom, Justice, Moderation Flag". Until it is officially adopted, it can also be referred to as "The People's Flag of Georgia".</p>

  <p><i class="text-info-emphasis">Where can I buy a flag? How much are they?</i> &mdash; <a href="mailto:flags@chad.org">Email Chad to find out.</a> More to say soon.</p>

  <p><i class="text-info-emphasis">Can I make Wisdom-Justice-Moderation flags and sell them?</i> &mdash; <a href="licensing">With conditions, yes.</a>
