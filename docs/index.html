  <h2 class="display-1">Georgia deserves a better flag</h2>

  <h2>A bold new look</h2>

  <p><strong>The current flag is complicated.</strong> There's a little soldier. Who would want to embroider the florid capital of the columns? And words? <strong>A child could not draw this flag</strong>, and that is a shame.</p>

  <p><strong>Blue and gold are beautiful.</strong> We should get rid of red to represent that we do not embrace the violence of the past. The white of innocence is lost too. We have a complicated past, but we do not have to revere it. Our bright golden future is what we should embrace.</a>

  <p>The columns of 

  <h1>People's Flag of Georgia</h1>

  <img src="People's Flag of Georgia.png" class="pt-5 px-5 img-fluid" alt="A flag for the people of Georgia. A deep blue field in te ratio of 19 width to 10 height, with three golden vertical stripes, equal in distance as in width to each other and to the outside edge. Alternating vertical strips of deep blue and gold, repeated to make four blue and three gold.">
  <div class="px-5 pb-5 d-flex fs-4 fw-bolder" style="color: #ffc107;"><div class="flex-fill"></div><div class="flex-fill text-center">Wisdom</div><div class="flex-fill"></div><div class="flex-fill text-center">Justice</div><div class="flex-fill"></div><div class="flex-fill text-center">Moderation</div><div class="flex-fill"></div></div>
  
  <p><img class="float-end" src="Seal_of_Georgia.svg" />The People's Flag of Georgia is the three gold columns of the constitution arch, on a field of blue. It repesents the principles that uphold the Rule of Law.</p>

  <h2>Reject the Confederacy</h2>

  <p>Sneer at idolators of the confederacy. Laugh at nebulous notions of <em>heritage</em>. The Confederacy was a blip in time that <em>did not even last as long as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Zune&amp;oldid=1297549345">the Microsoft Zune music player.</a></em> It didn't last as long as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Agents_of_S.H.I.E.L.D.&amp;oldid=1294546975#Episodes"><i>Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.</i></a>. You have cans in your pantry that have lasted longer. Those who revere it have an ignorant wisfulness for a time that was pretty terrible, even for the most privileged, and downright horrific for the least.</p>
  
  <p>Nor should we want it. We do not have to worship the shame of having thought humans could own other humans. It deserves neither our respect or even our very attention, except as a warning that Man is capable of evil.</p>

  <p>The flag that most represents The Confederacy should properly be thought of as the white flag of surrender, as that is the most productive thing the Confederacy accomplished &mdash; <em>ceasing to exist.</em></p>

  <h2>We don't need permission</h2>

  <p>The Georgia legislature gets to decide what flags fly over state property, but it doesn't get to decide what we think represents us. We can fly our own flag, and choose what we think is important to say about ourselves.

  <h2>FAQs</h2>

  <p><i>Doesn't this look like the maritime letter G?</i>  Yeah, a bit. Different stripes, and that flag is usually flown dangling, with the stripes horizontal. That is a happy conincidence, given that Georgia is the only US state that starts with a G.</p>

  <p><i>What are the height/width ratios?</i> Same as the flag of the USA: 19:10.</p>

  <p><i>What's the name of the flag?</i> It has one permanent name, "Wisdom, Justice, Moderation Flag". Until it is officially adopted, it can also be referred to as "The People's Flag of Georgia".</p>

  <!--p><i>Can I make them and sell them?</i> The design is copyright by Chad Miller, but the creator gives -->
